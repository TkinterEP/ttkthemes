Please note that while you can use some themes **only** under GPLv3 and that my code is also

## Usage
For more information about how to use this project in your own programs, please check out the
[documentation](https://ttkthemes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) on ReadTheDocs. You can also find
example images of the different included themes there, so you can choose one easily, as well
as examples on usage.
  
## Recommendations
The themes `plastik`, `clearlooks` and `elegance` are recommended to make your UI look nicer
on all platforms when using `Tkinter` and the `ttk` extensions in Python. When you are targeting
Ubuntu, consider using the great `radiance` theme.
