Themes
======

``ttkthemes`` includes a wide variety of different themes, and there is
always room for more themes, no matter how ugly or obscure! Even though
some themes may not be used in practice, the original goal of the
project has not been forgotten: To gather and preserve *all* themes.

Adapta
------
|adapta|

Aquativo
--------
|aquativo|

An Apple-style like theme by Pat Thoyts, created in 2004. The original site is listed to
be `http://www.fewt.com`, but you will only be able to view this site using the
Internet archive's Wayback machine. It appears the theme is related to the Ubuntu-based
Linux distribution _Fuduntu.

Arc
---
|arc|

The newest theme of the bunch. Being created by Sergei Golovan in 2015 this theme
requires Tk 8.6.0 in order to load. This is because the theme uses PNG images with
transparency, making for a blue-tinted modern look and feel.

Black
-----
|black|

A simple yet quite popular theme, as it is very consistent in its use of
dark colors in all widgets. Created by Mats Bengtsson in 2007.

Blue
----
|blue|

A theme that does live up to its name. This theme will burn your eyes out being so bright.
Everything is blue, though in some widgets there is a nice color gradient. This theme was
also created by Pat Thoyts in 2004.

Breeze
------
|breeze|

Clearlooks
----------
|clearlooks|

This theme was created by the Tcl/Tk developers team as a demo for what bitmap themes can do.
The light tints move toward peach colors, giving this theme a feminine look. It still looks
sleek and modern, and wouldn't be a bad choice. Just as with all themes though, the corners
are rounded.

Elegance
--------
|elegance|

A theme that appears to be created by the Tcl/Tk developers team. While attempts to
tracing its exact origin have been unsuccessful so far, this theme was probably created
around 2008. The theme can be found here_, but no author is listed.

Equilux
-------
|equilux|

Originally equilux_ is a GTK3 theme.

ITFT1
-----
|itft1|

Keramik
-------
|keramik| |keramik_alt|

These two themes use a single file ``keramik.tcl`` and the differences between them are fairly
limited. Originally developed by Pat Thoyts in 2004. These themes look the opposite of modern.
They are futuristic, but in a bit of a wrong way. Keramic_alt uses a different color scrollbar
element, namely silver instead of dark blue.

Kroc
----
|kroc|

This orange theme by David Zolli is busy on the eyes and has a wood-like grain in the Button
widgets. Not a recommended choice for modern UI development.

Plastik
-------
|plastik|

A nice looking theme created by Pat Thoyts in 2005. While not bolstering the most distinctive
features, it looks quite modern. Performance suffers heavily though, this is resolved by
commenting out line 193 of the ``plastik.tcl`` file. The theme changes only slightly because
of this change, but native performance is restored.

Radiance (Ubuntu)
-----------------
|radiance| |ubuntu|

A theme that was developed by the Tcl/Tk developers team. This theme, as the name suggests,
boasts the native look of Ubuntu's radiance theme, making for a good choice  when targeting
this platform. Large Progressbar widgets (namely in height) may look a bit mutated, so try
sticking to the normal Progressbar height.

Theme ``ubuntu`` is equal to radiance, except it uses transparent elements in place of some
white areas. Therefore, it looks a bit better when PNG-themes are available.

Scid themes
-----------
|scidblue| |scidgreen| |scidgrey| |scidmint| |scidpink| |scidpurple| |scidsand|

The scid themes form a group of themes that all share the same basic look but with
differently colored accents.

Smog
----
|smog|

waldorf
---------
|waldorf|

A theme based on the Crunchbang-Waldorf Gtk+ theme. Created by Fran√ßois Tonneau in 2016.

winxpblue
---------
|winxpblue|

A theme that tries to imitate the Windows XP look and feel created by Pat Thoyts in 2004. Not
recommended, even for Windows XP applications.

yaru
----
|yaru|

Theme derived from the new Ubuntu 20.04 default theme and theme 'arc'.
